{"meta":{"app":"CFDTool","author":"Precise Simulation","build":"1.4","date":"02-Sep-2019","descr":["This heat exchanger example illustrates the multiphysics modeling capabilities of CFDTool. The model consists of a series of heated pipes surrounded by a fluid at a lower temperature, and features effects of both free and forced convection. Two types of physical phenomena are considered, fluid flow which is modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations, and heat transfer modeled by a convection and conduction transport equation for the temperature. This system features a two-way multiphysics coupling, the fluid is coupled to and transports the temperature field, and the temperature is also coupled back to the fluid via the Boussinesq approximation accounting for buoyancy effects.","","Due to symmetry one can simplify the full geometry and only study a two dimensional slice between the heated pipes. The geometry will therefore consist of a _0.0075_ by _0.05 m_ rectangle from which a half circle with radius _0.003 m_ centered at _(0, 0.02)_ is removed. The mechanism for heating the pipes is not taken in consideration and are thus assumed to be at a fixed temperature of _Th = 330 K_. A cooling fluid flows from the bottom to the top and has an inlet temperature of _Tc = 300 K_. The other fluid and material parameters can be found in the model tutorial."],"dim":2,"image":"heat_exchanger1.jpg","keyw":["quickstart","heat_exchanger"],"mlver":"R2019a","name":"heat_exchanger1","phys":["Heat Transfer","Navier-Stokes Equations"],"system":"","time":737442,"title":"Heat Exchanger","type":"Multiphysics","user":"precsim","ver":[1,4,0]},
